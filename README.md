LCA.py contains the main functions for the program.

The findPath() and findLCA() functions were created for the first part of the assignment 
and were used for non-DAG unit test cases.

The check_for_two_paths(), is_tree_DAG() and find_LCA_DAG() functions were created 
for the branch part of the assignment and used in DAG unit test cases.

__________________________________________________________

TestLCA.py contains the unit testing.

All unit test cases except the final 3 cases pass. The final 3 cases test more complex cases
and I was unable to edit my functions to solve these cases.
